# Algorithms & Data Structures Course DRAFT
Main purpose of this course is to master effective algorithms to solve coding problems and to introduce main data structures. It is assumed that one has little to none knowledge of C++ and I would personally suggest to use C++ for solving proposed tasks. All algorithms will also be written in Python3, so doing assignments on Python3 is also acceptable.
